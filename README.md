# Fashion-Images-recognition

#### In this project, I was using 10 different machine learning techniques to get the best Accuracy&Points on Fashion-MNIST Dataset. Those models areï¼š
* Ensemble model
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Simple Sequential model
* Neural Networks
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Multinomial logistic regression
* Classification Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines
* Generalized Boosted Regression Models


### I knit a html report which is easier to read. Please Download and open it by browser
