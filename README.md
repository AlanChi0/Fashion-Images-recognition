# Fashion-Images-recognition

#### In this project, I was using 10 different machine learning techniques, including：
* Ensemble model
* Convolutional Neural Network/Simple Sequential model/Neural Networks/K-Nearest Neighbors/Multinomial logistic regression/Classification Tree/Random Forest/Support Vector Machines/Generalized Boosted Regression Models, to get the best accuracy on Fashion-MNIST Dataset.


### I knit a html report which is easier to read。
